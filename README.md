# randomBash
Random Bash scripts to do things.

# parseIOC
Sloppy script to parse potential IOC's from PDF's. Useful for an analyst trying to speed up/automate blocking IOC's from threat reports. Regex for IP's/URL's was grabbed from online somewhere, only regex I wrote was for hashes.

# abuseScrape
Grabs the SSL Blacklist feed from abuse.ch and removes headers and footers to give you a clean file of time/date, hash and threat source. You can then import the CSV data into your desired tool.
